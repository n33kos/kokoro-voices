# kokoro-voices

This repository contains my custom created kokoro voices for personal use. I've used various methods of manipulating the original voice tensors to create new and unique voices.

## Usage

To use these voices, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n33kos/kokoro-voices.git
   ```
2. Copy the desired voice files to your kokoro voice directory. The location of this directory may vary depending on your setup, but it is typically found in the installation folder of your kokoro software.
3. Reference the new voices in your kokoro configuration or commands as needed.
